# Lung Cancer Prediction

This project predicts the likelihood of lung cancer using a machine learning model.

## Features
- Predicts lung cancer risk based on medical attributes
- Uses supervised ML algorithms (like Random Forest, SVM)
- Provides classification results for patient data

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

## Setup

1. Clone the repo or download the ZIP.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Place your dataset CSV in the `data/` folder.
4. Run the script:

```bash
python lung_cancer_prediction.py
```
